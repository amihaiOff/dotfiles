## Brewfile
This file lists a bunch of tools to download and install. Run with `brew bundle --global` (after installing brew)

## Vim
- colorscheme - [everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) (via plug in)
- statusbar - [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

## iTerm2 - deprecated
- Good set up tips can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MiGnwPdNGE)
  - Main points are Quake style terminal (dropdown from the top)
  - powerlevel 10K theme (doesn't work with starship - this is also a prompt manager)
- Good iTerm2 tips can be found [here](https://stevenpcurtis.medium.com/make-your-life-easier-with-iterm2-a-terminal-replacement-343c08fc854f)
- [To enable ctrl+F keys (for byobu)](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/281033/sending-ctrlfunction-key-on-iterm2)

## Lightshot
* Can cancel cmd + shift + 4 as screen shot in MacOS and make shortcut for Lightshot 
  * This will also make the screenshot button on keychron keyboards work

## Karabiner
- [Use karabiner for launching apps with shortcuts](https://www.tristanfarmer.dev/blog/using-karabiner-for-app-window-management)
  - In order to launch vivaldi use the following command: `osascript -e 'activate application \"Vivaldi\"'`
### Complex Modification
- Change left_shift+space to underscore(_)
- CapsLock to Hyper
- Hyper Application
- Left ctrl + hjkl to arrow keys Vim style

## Other
- <ins>aws_instances</ins> - lists the instance names of ec2 machines and their respective cpus count and memory. Should be given an alias to print to terminal
- <ins>byobu_cheat_sheet</ins> - command list for byobu. Should be given an alias to print to terminal.
- <ins>general_cheatsheet.vim</ins> - a command list for vim/pycharm/others - trying to combine all shortcuts in one

## System wide vim
I tried vim mode plus but it confilcts with caps -> escape and doens't have things like `wid`. For now using left ctrl + hjkl which I can
combine with `option` key to skip words or with shift to highlight words. 

## PyCharm plugins
- ideavim
- copilot
- sourcery
- atom material icons
- material theme UI
- One dark theme
- tab shifter (might not be in use)
- forest night (might not be in use)

## Using stow for symlinks
1. Create folder in this repo.
2. Use `stow -t [target_folder] [source folder]`
This will create a symlink for all files in source folder, in the target folder. Any additional files in targer folder will remain untouched. 
For any file that already exists in the target folder the operation will fail. 

## Cursor
Create a symlink for settings.json and keybindings.json in ~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User
